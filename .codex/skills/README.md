# Repo-scoped Codex skills

Put repo-scoped skills here so Codex can load them when working in this repository.

Recommended pattern:
- Keep each skill **narrow** (one workflow)
- Prefer **scripts + templates** over long prose
- Evolve skills when you notice repeat mistakes

Folder layout (per skill):
- `<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- optional: `scripts/`, `assets/`, `references/`

Skill discovery locations are documented in the Codex Skills docs.
